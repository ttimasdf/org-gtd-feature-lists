Identified by the correctness of Emacs syntax highlighting
=( ) $ - ^ ~ ! & * `=
*** And sign, minus and plus
=& - += can be used to input several tags at a time, which is easier to
type than =:= (easier? maybe =-= is a little bit easier)

Simply input an =-= or =&= will lead to a single =:=
which cannot be identified and replaced automatically by org. It will
consider it part of the heading. That may be a bug.
