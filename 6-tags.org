Identified by the correction of Emacs syntax highlighting
`( ) $ - ^ ~ ! & * =`
*** And sign, minus and plus
`& - +` can be used to input several tags at a time, which is easier to
type than `:`(easier?)

Simply input an `-` or `&` will lead to a single ` : `
which cannot be identified and replaced automatically by org. It will
consider it part of the heading.
